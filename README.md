# mountain-climbers
Puzzle generation for a new genre of logic puzzles.

Rules as follows: Each mountain is being climbed simultaneously by some number of climbers, whose paths begin at the base of the mountain, only ever move upwards, and cannot cross. Numbers indicate supplies, and the height a climber reaches must equal the amount of supplies they gather along the way.

Puzzles generated exhaustively, with some heuristics in order to avoid needless searching. Example puzzles, small representatives, and a larger proof of concept can be found at the links below.
